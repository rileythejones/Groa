Things we need from front end:
- Username (IMDb and Letterboxd(hopefully)) -- Page: Import Reviews (maybe homepage)
- Manually put in a review --- Page:Submit Reviews (needs movie title, review, (review title) title predictor dropdown(film not here)?
    - user input: username, user_rating, review_title
    - dropdown: original_title or primary_title 
- View recommendations from model - persist on the recommendations we have served to each user ((issue for future web team))
    - have a page that returns recommendations
    - Whether they like or dislike recommendations (thumbs up or down) (either add to watchlist or won't watch)
- View watch history
    - Table? Include "results for username watch history" as title, columns: primary_title, review_date, review_title (clickable link to full review text)
    - make it clickable so you can mix and match which movies they want to server to the model
    - feature it as thumbnails
- Serve users their previous reviews (show them what they've already reviewed from other places.)
- import ratings and use 7-10 as stuff for preliminary recommendation
    -then give list and give options for serving to recommender
