"""Review2Vec (R2V) is the second type of model we designed for Groa.
We trained Gensim's Doc2Vec word embedding model on documents containing all the
reviews a user has written on IMDb. Restricting our training data to only those
users who had written at least 6 reviews, we represented almost 60k IMDb users
in this model. R2V can then be used to infer a vector for a new user's movie
reviews, and find "r2v-similar" users. We query those similar users to find cult
movies and hidden gems that the Groa user might enjoy.

Hidden gems are movies are well regarded but relatively underdiscovered. To find
them, we query the database for movies enjoyed by r2v-similar users, having
between 1k and 10k votes.

Cult movies are movies that some users enjoy much more than the average.
Our goal is to provide the user with movies that they might watch and
consider underrated. We query the database for r2v-similar users, and select
movies they rate at least three stars above the average. A lengthier query can
also be found in the SQL directory, which finds movies rated at least 2 standard
deviations above the average, but this query was too slow to be used in the app.
A future team could solve this problem by storing the standard deviation of each
movie's ratings in the movies table."""
