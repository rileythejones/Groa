            <h1>What Is Gróa?</h1>
            <p>The companies which have the resources to create an elegant Movie Recommendation Engine have a
                profit motive aligned with recommending high cost proprietary content rather than films their customers would genuinely enjoy.
                Existing web sites geared towards providing a recommendation rely entirely on basic rating
                models which are weighted heavily towards popular films and generally do a poor job identifying unique outliers.
                Gróa will use NLP to create unique recommendations based upon the way
                in which users talk about movies rather than the reductive 1-5 or 1-10 rating system.</p>
