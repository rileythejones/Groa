In order to run the flask app, first you need to set it to the right file. 
In Windows, we go: set FLASK_APP=application.py.
In other systems, we go: export FLASK_APP=application.py.
Now that flask knows which file to run, type in 'flask run'
If you want to be in debug mode: export FLASK_ENV=development
In window, replace export with set
