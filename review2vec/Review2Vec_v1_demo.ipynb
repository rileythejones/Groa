    "\n",
    "Review2Vec (R2V) is the second type of model we designed for Groa. We trained Gensim's Doc2Vec word embedding model on documents containing all the reviews a user has written on IMDb. Restricting our training data to only those users who had written at least 6 reviews, we represented almost 60k IMDb users in this model. R2V can then be used to infer a vector for a new user's movie reviews, and find \"r2v-similar\" users. We query those similar users to find cult movies and hidden gems that the Groa user might enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden gems are movies are well regarded but relatively underdiscovered. To find them, we query the database for movies enjoyed by r2v-similar users, having between 1k and 10k votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cult movies are movies that some users enjoy much more than the average. Our goal is to provide the user with movies that they might watch and consider underrated. We query the database for r2v-similar users, and select movies they rate at least three stars above the average. A lengthier query can also be found in the SQL directory, which finds movies rated at least 2 standard deviations above the average, but this query was too slow to be used in the app. A future team could solve this problem by storing the standard deviation of each movie's ratings in the movies table."

Ive had to limit the number of times I watch this just because I dont want the experience to stale.Id recommend this musical to anyone with an off-kilter sense of humor who yearn to stretch the limits of what constitutes a film. Every time I watch it I see something new.There really isnt another film I could compare it to and give it justice, so I wont... but I love camp, British humor, and musicals so if you have similar tastes give it a shot.And if youre one of the ones who love it, youll be humming the tunes (bim bam boom) and screening the Forbidden Zone with your friends!',\n",

Picks up 27 years after the events of the original, you know, when the Losers Club defeated Pennywise, had a child orgy and made a promise to come back if Pennywise returned. Thats not what happened? And right on schedule Robert Gray appears back on the scene to eat some children. Mike Hanlon, the only member of the Losers Club to stay in Derry and witnesses whats going on, starts making some calls to the other members of the group and asks them all to come home, the issue with that is, people who leave Derry tend to forget Derry, so it takes some begging, and they all all make it home, well, almost. And as they each explore the town, Pennywise comes out to play to welcome them home, cause hes missed them, theyre like the ones that got away. Leading up to a showdown to bring an end to Pennywise, once and for all. Pretty sweet creepy effects once again, good casting of the adult losers club!! End Pennywise once and for all.. LOL... Yes the million years old Pennywise was defeated by the Losers Club, which they did 27 years prior as well. How did the defeat him once and for all, by performing a ritual passed down to Mike by a group of Native Americans, who performed the ritual and then were promptly eaten by Pennywise. My guess is, Pennywise likes these games. At the end of the day, Pennywise finished his cycle of eating Derrys precious little bundles of joy, got a kick out of The Losers Club actually coming back to get their asses kicked once again, losing a few losers along the way, put on a little show for them, and went to sleep, and will come back to suck the marrow from their grandchildrens bones in 27 years. :) All Hail The Crimson King!!

Say what you will about Seagal but he gave us UNDER SIEGE 1 and 2 and he got sucked out into the clouds in the Stuart Baird thrill-ride EXECUTIVE DECISION. And for these 3 films Im eternally thankful. I still cant change the channel every time this one comes on. Cmon! Trains, terrorists, Katherine Heigl, Seagal at his most zen-like, and Everett McGill as Penn who uses pepper spray as a breath spray. Whats not to like? And a techno-nerd bad guy who looks like a demented cross between Elliott Gould and Tim Curry! With classic lines like Your safety IS our primary concern. However, if you try anything stupid, Federal Regulations require that I kill you Im surprised this thing didnt win the Oscar for best script...lol.But seriously, with so much testosterone flying around, helped by Basil Poledouriss rousing score, and so much cool train climbing action (over, under, all over) I sometimes wonder if this one isnt even better than the first one - helmed by Andrew Davis. I mean the Eric Bogosian/Everett McGill combo is just as good as the Tommy Lee Jones/Gary Busey combo! And the kill quip by Seagal (after he dispatches McGill) Nobody beats me in the kitchen is right up there with some of the best quips in the Bond pictures.Anyway its one of the top films of 1995. I have come to the conclusion that you just cant go wrong when using the DIE HARD formula. I have yet to see a bad DIE HARD clone. SPEED, CLIFFHANGER, UNDER SIEGE, SUDDEN DEATH, AIR FORCE ONE, CON AIR, etc. Die Hard on a Bus, Die Hard on a Mountain, Die Hard on a Ship/Train, Die Hard in a Hockey Arena, Die Hard on a Plane, etc.',\n",

I will admit that its social relevance would have likely had greater impact had it been made at least two decades earlier, but the discussion surrounding the more implicit racial tensions that exist in our supposedly politically correct modern society rather than the explicit ones that we are intended to believe are now solely a part of our sordid past may hold even more importance to some viewers.Indeed, it is probable that many find the reversal of events depicted herein to be the result of overactive imaginations, delusions found only in cinematic representations of cross-racial interactions. However, having witnessed similar circumstances and having known a considerable number of people whose accounts are fascinatingly similar to the tendencies portrayed, I found it to be a very accurate study of our human need to find fault with another for whatever reason is most readily available to us.The role reversal played out far better than in any movie that comes to mind as of this writing, and the acting and overall experience served to support the writer/directors vision perfectly.I obviously gave this film ten stars, and would (and always do) recommend it to someone willing to have an open mind who chooses to further their understanding of underlying social structures in a more visceral sense.',\n",

I have this awful tendency to hand out tens to movies which are so bad they cross the line into total awesome. Its a problem and I should try to stop, but Im not there just yet.Over time and many, many terrible, pretentious films, Ive learned that David A.R. White is the cream of the crop when it comes to the bizarro world of Xtian filmmaking. He also bears an uncanny resemblance to a very good friend of mine, but why should you care about that? I know you dont, Im rambling. Anyhow.I saw the first Encounter when digging through instantwatchers Faith and Spirituality section looking for documentaries and soon after that I was hunting down these things like a junkie looks for a fix. The sanctimony drips from the screen, the awful dialogue sometimes ripped directly from the Bible so as not to offend the faithful, the preachy nonsense--all of thats on display here. Its sort of like watching a Jack Chick tract come to life, and in my opinion theres absolutely nothing bad about that. All these films lack are cartoon devils yelling HAW HAW HAW at the folks unlucky enough to burn in never ending hellfire. If you want to watch something so terrible that it might make you giggle, check out the wild and wooly world of Xtian film. Watch this movie!

The most important thing is that she is a lawyer and ultimately, we all want to see the lawyer get killed in the end (Jurassic Park). THe special FX are really good, complete with jumping out of 20 storey buildings and there is ample amounts of gore to satisfy the gore fan. There are a few good shock scenes but this isnt a shocker movie. I classify it as a thriller, because it revolves around the mystique of the werewolf.

       "   'I saw Inland Empire in Seattle; David Lynch introduced the film (with a cellist playing an improvisation, followed by DL saying about 2 sentences) I knew only a few things about the film: it was shot all on digital video, and it was 3 hours long. Having seen all of Lynchs previous work I knew that I was in for a ride. I also knew that there was no way to know what kind of ride it would be: I was strapped in and ready. I heard the woman sitting behind me say, Ive never seen a David Lynch film before. What are they like? And I thought, She is either very lucky or she is going to have a horrible night. Or both. I remember the first time I saw Eraserhead. It was playing on the midnight movie circuit when I was in college. After I stumbled out of the theater I realized that my perception of the world had changed, perhaps unalterably. The movie knocked on some of the darkest doors in my psyche, and I didnt like that one bit. At least at first. Then I noticed that there were times in my life when I could sit back and say, This is life imitating Eraserhead. There was a bizarre comfort in that. A friend persuaded me to see Eraserhead again about a year later. The second viewing revealed a deep level of comedy I had completely missed the first time. (Do I just cut them up like regular chickens?) By the end of the second viewing I knew I would seek out whatever this guy might put forth. And I am ever so glad I did. Okay. Back to Inland Empire. The only thing I can say, really, is that the best way to see this movie is to just sink into it. Let it wash into you. Dont try to figure it out. Dont try to find linear threads, clues, connections. The movie exists in its own space, dimension, world, and time. It is, at times, too close. It is, at time, achingly beautiful. It is, at times, exceedingly funny. It is, at times, unutterably dark. If you have seen a David Lynch movie in the past and have stomped away from the theater saying, It doesnt mean anything! Its stupid! David Lynch is just being cryptic for no reason at all! then I suggest that you stick with movies where the hero is easily recognized as such, his girlfriend always wears pretty clothes and everything turns out just right in the end. Because you are not going to get that in a David Lynch movie. Things will not be spelled out for you in block letters. Today may turn into tomorrow, and there may be no way the beginning of the movie can exist in the same world as the end of the movie. There may be images that are startlingly disturbing, but with no clear explanation as to why they are there. You need to be willing to let the images be the images, let the sounds be the sounds, and let the experience be the experience. That is the way to enjoy a David Lynch film. And this one is the Lynchiest of them all. I loved the fact that the comments David Lynch provided after the movie were not explanations, or a key to symbols, or anything that would tell us how to interpret the movie. Someone asked him point-blank: Will you tell me what it means so I dont have to go to the internet to find out? And he said, Its on the poster. (A woman in trouble) She said, Is that all Im going to get? And he said, Thats all youre going to get. There was a round of chuckles in the audience. I think DL may have felt a little bad for being that terse, so he went on to say, Everyone sees a movie in his own way. No ones experience is any more right or wrong than anyone elses. I dont talk about my films after theyre finished, because I dont want to turn film back into words. I think I know what he means. After you spend so much time conveying thoughts - via words - into actions, sounds and images, it seems backwards and pointless to reverse that whole process.So.Watch Inland Empire. Go with your mind empty. Dont expect anything. Let the movie carry you along on its own tide. When the movie is over, get out of the boat and go home. You dont need to know any more than that.I think this film is one of the purest expressions of art that I have seen.',\n",

Also I do NOT understand why this has low ratings bc It is a VERY VERY great movie! Well written, well acted and very intriguing. When Paul is in the café and the stranger offers him the smokes he likes I actually thought then that they didnt make it out of the crash. I have seen a different horror movie like this where they were trapped in a hotel and all being murdered and at the end they really had just been in a wreck, so very different movie but on a similar idea. However dont get me wrong, other than that similarity it is completely different. I REALLY liked the little twist at the end and was sad it ended! The fact that it was somewhat confusing at parts wasnt a negative thing, it actually kept my attention thru the somewhat slow beginning, so I have no complaints. I didnt think I was really going to enjoy this much when I began because of the awful reviews. The only reason I think it does have low ratings is due to the fact that most people OBVIOUSLY did NOT get the meaning & did not understand it whatsoever. It really made me think and I felt like the characters were really there and I wanted to know more about them! So very very well thought out movie with outstanding acting. I dont usually recommend movies to friends and family bc Im more of a book reader, however this is one I will be going out of my way to suggest to everyone. I definitely recommend and you should have an open mind going into this and just hang in there, if you pay attention I know you will really enjoy it as well.',\n",

So after skydiving out of their plane that was blowing up around them, whats left of a team of soldiers, head off to a local village where the Nazis have a tower located, that needs to be taken out to help with the invasion of the Allies. But they go ahead and poke their noses where it dont belong and they mingle with a few locals and get attached and discover that the Third Reich is using the people to experiment on to create a thousand year soldier for the thousand year long Reich. It was a pretty exciting bloody war movie for sure! Comes with some stereotypes from other WW2 flicks...the soldier that just isnt supposed to be there...the one with the New York accent, the strong quiet guy in charge, and of course the Jewish soldier there to kill Hitler himself.

It tells the tale of Casey, a shy, timid guy, perfectly played by Jesse Eisenberg. And one night while taking a stroll to the store to get his little Dachshund some dinner, hes attacked by three masked bad guys on motorcycles, and they kick the living poo poop out of him. Some time in the emergency room and a few weeks at home healing, Casey now finds it almost impossible to walk out the front door, PTSD, I believe youd call it. And hes sick of it, man!! So the next day he walks into a Karate studio, and he meets the sensei, who goes by: Sensei, and this guy is what Casey wants to be! He signs on the dotted line and begins lessons and soon discovers this is exactly what he needs even though it is nothing at all what he expected!! Darkly comical, some brutal violence thrown in, and the most well spoken movie I think ive seen! Id say you would definitely have to be into the dark comedy genre to enjoy this one, and lots of low key humor that I think deserves a second watch, do it, do it now... Filmbufftim on FB.',\n",

So maybe she was supposed to die then and a demon took over her soul. Any way the movie doesnt take long to get going which is good. You are waiting in anticipation to see how it will end. I like the acting, the good part is that they play a couple well. She never wanted to have the baby in the first place and she gets angry that she is having it because she was on the pill. The parts where she breaks the car window and eats the raw meat in the grocery store are memorable. This isnt a bad movie at all.',\n",

Gore and horrow dont phase me in the slightest, like watching a Disney movie, I cant think of a single movie ever made that really creeped me out significantly, but this one was VERY close. I mean really what the movie leaves your thoughts with AFTER IT ENDS, that is when you know a movie has succeeded and this was one of those movies. I was very surprised that this movie was so good bc I was not expecting it to be even remotely interesting. It was well made well directed well acted and all around creepy and great! Not to mention I was so happy to see that there werent ridiculous parts of named hot girls running around! Not that I have anything against that, I mean Im 54 110lbs with triple ds so I definitely get it,but from a womans standpoint it was nice to see a beautiful real life woman play a leading role for a change! It just made it all that more relate able and real and was just brilliant. Hands down great job all around in every area, its a must see. 10 stars **. Id also like to agree with other reviewers, this is one of first movies I can honestly say I didnt know exactly where they were going at first, even when you think you have it figured its so different and off the wall its brilliant, I dont use that often or EVER for a movie review, I cant believe he didnt have much of a budget, just goes to show you a genuinely good vision doesnt need all the glitz and glam, and it still tops any movie in its genre with a huge budget, with its non existent one!

First off, its a horror movie, so unrealistic things are going to happen. But if the characters behave in an average joe sort of way to these extreme situations, the movie works. And it works here in spades. Second, the pacing is spot on. From beginning to end, something is happening to move the story along.The story behind the girls body is slowly revealed over time in bits and pieces. And as the truth comes out, the characters behave accordingly. Its that simple and this makes for a great horror movie.',\n",

There were also moments where I felt like it was going to go even further into madness. When the kid starts fantasizing about the maid after shes been buried for a few days...I was half-expecting him to go and desecrate the body sexually. This rich estate, was like a living breathing hell, complete with the ants crawling over everything and everyone who was dying. I really wish that the maid didnt die, mainly because she was freaking hot as hell. Awesome legs. Finally, the music really tied it all together, the music is masterfully composed. Expert soundtrack.',\n",

Mads Mikkelsen plays a hitman named Duncan approaching his 50th birthday, which in his way of life, ya know, getting paid to kill anyone the boss tells you too, hes approaching retirement, and his boss Blut, played so good by Matt Lucas, has a pretty sweet retirement plan, 8 million bucks! And well, we all know bosses suck, Blut does not intend to pay out, instead sends a team of young assassins to well ease him into retirement another way. However, Duncan is really, really good at his job. And when they cant get to him and they mess with the sweet pretty troubled neighbor, Camille, played by Vanessa Hudgens, well he just cant let that happen. Based on a Dark Horse graphic novel, great dark humor, and super violent... Ahhhh. Bravo Netflix! Filmbufftim on FB.',\n",

We all can picture an evil clown in our head, and this one is no exception, in simple black and white paint and a satanic grin, and carrying around a black garbage bag, and instantly Art and the women click. Dawn, falling into the dumb blonde role doesnt sense the danger, while Tara the brunette stays away, will that help her. And once they leave Art follows, and as luck would have it, their car broke down and they have to walk, and youd never guess what happens next. Total campy movie, with laughs and over the top gore.

Was nice to see something that was from a different perspective. I guess U could kinda compare to the lovely bones movie but honestly I didnt feel like it was too similar or anything. I liked it a lot. Didnt get up not once the whole movie. I give it 10 stars bc it deserves much higher than whats given. I dont do many reviews but this one deserved my time and I definitely would give it a Chance if you prefer more psychological than gory type scary movies. I was to think not see lots of blood.',\n",

There is expert pacing and the music is perfectly arranged. There is a constant edge-of-your-seat kind of feeling; like a tense vibration.There is all this background philosophical musing that I love in movies. This is what separates the great movies from the OK movies. This movie makes your brain go into a warm coalescing type frequency.She is an alien, as a matter of fact, you can tell that she is. The chemistry with her and Jack is good too. This is one of those movies that you just want it to keep going. The final scenes show all of Jack, his wife, Stone, Stones wife all separated, looking into the ether. Stone is what humans are at first, after a long time they graduate to becoming human. Then as a human, they try and amend all their past mistakes until balance is reached. God is like a huge boxer holding his hand out on the tiny opponents head as he flails away, this is Satan.

Then...the movie ends with Joe killing all the old weak (and purely evil) people in the town. I guess he wants to let God sort them out and do what he will with them. ;)You get inserted right into this cinematic reality within seconds of the opening credits. Descriptive words that would suit this little community: dirty, dingy, tattered, desperate, dusty, liquored-up, violent, tough etc. The guy is a great actor, has he won an award yet? He plays the part perfect. The other cast is great. The kid from Mud, he is a good inclusion. That guy with the scar on his face; man one look at his face and you see pure desolation. I dont know where they found that guy but he looks absolutely sadistic.The first half hour features a team of blacks killing trees, an old lady with Mexicans trying to skin a deer lulz, and him getting shot with a shotgun in the chest but that doesnt phase him. Then the Dad beats the life out of that other Drunk with a rusty piece of metal and steals his wine. That was a disturbing scene.Ultimately, it all goes to hell in the end, as you would expect, and the right people die. Joe ends up being a sort of guardian angel that cleans up the mess that is this dirty town.I went through a windshield and I dont give a ! (that guys hilarious)Great acting and a good view.',\n",

Its now one of my favorites from 1965 - only THUNDERBALL, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE are better. Anyhoo, Gregory Peck does a great job playing an amnesiac while Walter Matthau delivers another superbly humorous performance (as he did in CHARADE) as a private investigator whose first case just happens to be Peck.

And then, the most incredible use of 3D I have ever seen. Not only does the title card not appear until an hour and 20 minutes into the film, the subsequent and final shot of the film is a towering 59 minute psuedo dream sequence that ties up every loose thread from the first part of the movie. Artistic and poetic, I will fully admit that I did not understand everything- especially with all of the Mandarin name dropping in the first part and the convolusion (I went to the bathroom and when I returned there was a long shot of an androgynous person crying and eating an apple. The entire apple I might add) however, this is without a doubt a unique experience. It may not be the most enjoyable experience to watch, but I promise you you will never forget it, and you will leave the theater feeling as though youve just watched something that is truly masterfully crafted and a one of a kind - which it is.
