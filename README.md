## Project Overview


 [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ZyU1nW83/labs19-movierecommender)
We use Trello as a quick wireframe tracker through the first stages of development. As the product moves past releases 1.1 and 1.2 we will transition away from Trello and into the git ecosystem entirely. 

 [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/b593b3d6c6ca41b5a32871e10e4ac3b7?v=bfe15a25eab44b15bfdc04fd1763cc2e)
This notion document serves as a solid resource if you want to learn more about our motivations for creating this product and the general development direction it is taking.

### Project Description

The companies which have the resources to create an elegant Movie Recommendation Engine have a profit motive aligned with recommending high cost proprietary content rather than films their customers would genuinely enjoy.

Existing web sites geared towards providing a recommendation rely entirely on basic rating models which are weighted heavily towards popular films and generally do a poor job identifying unique outliers.

Movie Recommendation Engine will use NLP to create unique recommendations based upon the way in which users talk about movies rather than the reductive 1-5 or 1-10 rating system.

#### Machine Learning:

#### Data Collection/Manipulation:

### Predictions

Based on the user's movie ratings and reviews, provide recommendations for movies to watch that they have never before considered watching. We can do this by vectorizing the user's Letterboxd or IMDb reviews and finding cosine-similar matches from 22GB worth of movie reviews. Results can be filtered to remove movies the user has already watched, so long as they provide their data exported from one of those sites.
